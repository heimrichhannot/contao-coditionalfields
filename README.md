# Contao - Conditionalfields

Define dependencies between fields. Conditional fields can be created as Radio Button or Select Menu.
In the form configuration dialog of other fields, you can choose wether the field should have a dependency to this field or not.

If a user selects the condition, the dependent fields will appaer.
 
**This is no javascript solution, the validation is done one the server-side by php.**

# Requirements

* >= Contao 3.3.0 (maybe works also with 3.0 Versions, but not tested yet)
